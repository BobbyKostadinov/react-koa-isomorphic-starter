# React Koa Isomorphic Starter

This is a starter project for an isomorphic React application.
Inspired by (with some heavy borrowing) https://github.com/nemtsov/react-isomorphic-starter


## Usage

Development:
`npm install`
`gulp dev`

Production:
`npm install`
`npm start --harmony`

(Notice the harmony flag. For current Node version. 0.12.0 this is still required to run EC6 generators that KOA needs)
